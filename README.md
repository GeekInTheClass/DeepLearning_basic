 ## _DeepLearning_basic_
 
 Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms.
 
 > - Use a cascade of multiple layers of nonlinear processing units for feature extraction and transformation. Each successive layer uses the output from the previous layer as input
 > - Learn in supervised or unsupervised manners
 > - Learn multiple levels of representations that correspond to different levels of abstraction; the levles form a hierarchy of conceps.
 
 ### _Algorithms_
 
 ####  Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
 > A deep neural network is an ANN with multiple hidden layers between the input and output layers. Similar to shallow ANNs, DNNs can model complex non-linear replationshops. DNN architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layerd composition of primitives.
 
 ####  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
 > CNN is a kind of multilayer perceptrons designed to use minimal preprocessing. CNN is composed of one or several layers of synthetic products and layers of general artificial neural networks stacked on top of it. and utilizes additional weighting and pooling layers.
 
 ####  Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
 > RNN refers to the neural network in which the connections between the units that make up the artificial neural network. RNN can utilize memory inside a neural network to process arbitrary inputs, unlike pre-neural networks. By this characteristic, RNN is utilized in fields such as handwriting recognition.
 
 ### _Applications_
 
 ####  Automatic speech recognition
 > Large-scale automatic speech recognition is the first and most convincing successful case of deep learning.

 ####  Image recognition
 > A common evaluation set for image classification is the MNIST database data set. MNIST is composed of handwritten digits and includes 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples.
 > Deep learning-based image recognition has become "superhuman", producing more accurate results than human contestants.
 
 ####  Visual art processing
 > Closely related to the progress that has been made in image recognition is the increasing application of deep learning tecchniques to various visual art tasks.
 
 ####  Natural language processing
 > Neural networks have been used for implementing language modles since the early 2000s. LSTM helped to improve machine translation and language modeling.
