 ## _DeepLearning_basic_ 

Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms.

> - Use a cascade of multiple layers of nonlinear processing units for feature extraction and transformation. Each successive layer uses the output from the previous layer as input
> - Learn in supervised or unsupervised manners
> - Learn multiple levels of representations that correspond to different levels of abstraction; the levles form a hierarchy of conceps.

### _Algorithms_

 ####  Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
> A deep neural network is an ANN with multiple hidden layers between the input and output layers. Similar to shallow ANNs, DNNs can model complex non-linear replationshops. DNN architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layerd composition of primitives.
       
 ####  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
> CNN is a kind of multilayer perceptrons designed to use minimal preprocessing. CNN is composed of one or several layers of synthetic products and layers of general artificial neural networks stacked on top of it. and utilizes additional weighting and pooling layers.

 ####  Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
> RNN refers to the neural network in which the connections between the units that make up the artificial neural network. RNN can utilize memory inside a neural network to process arbitrary inputs, unlike pre-neural networks. By this characteristic, RNN is utilized in fields such as handwriting recognition.

### _Applications_

 ####  Automatic speech recognition
> Large-scale automatic speech recognition is the first and most convincing successful case of deep learning.
