 ## _DeepLearning_basic_ 

Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms.

> - Use a cascade of multiple layers of nonlinear processing units for feature extraction and transformation. Each successive layer uses the output from the previous layer as input
> - Learn in supervised or unsupervised manners
> - Learn multiple levels of representations that correspond to different levels of abstraction; the levles form a hierarchy of conceps.

### _Algorithms_

 #### (1) Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
> A deep neural network is an ANN with multiple hidden layers between the input and output layers. Similar to shallow ANNs, DNNs can model complex non-linear replationshops. DNN architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layerd composition of primitives.
