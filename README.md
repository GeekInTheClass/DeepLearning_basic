 ## _DeepLearning_basic_ 

Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms.

- Use a cascade of multiple layers of nonlinear processing units for feature extraction and transformation. Each successive layer uses the output from the previous layer as input
- Learn in supervised or unsupervised manners
- learn multiple levels of representations that correspond to different levels of abstraction; the levels form a hierarchy of concepts.
